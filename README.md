# Netflix-Content-Data-Analysis-
In this project, I analyzed Netflix content data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights. The project involved several critical steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Utilized a publicly available dataset containing details of Netflix content such as titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and more.
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing categorical values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize data.
Key Insights and Trends:

Analyzed content distribution by genre, release year, and content type (movies vs. TV shows).
Identified popular genres and trends in content release over the years.
Examined the relationship between content ratings and other features.
Visualization and Reporting:

Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings, including bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
Highlighted significant trends, such as the increasing diversity of genres and the shift towards more original content over time.
Actionable Insights:

Provided strategic recommendations based on analysis, such as potential areas for content expansion and targeting specific genres or demographics.
This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, EDA, and data visualization, and provided valuable insights into the trends and patterns of Netflixâ€™s content library.
